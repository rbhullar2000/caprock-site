    summary: "Why getting pre-approved is smart before shopping.",
    content: `Getting pre-approved for a car loan is a critical first step for any buyer. It helps you establish a realistic budget, sets expectations for interest rates, and allows you to shop like a cash buyer.

When you're pre-approved, you already know how much you can borrow and what your payments will look like. That helps streamline your entire shopping experience.

Pre-approval also improves your credibility when working with a dealership or private seller. You’re seen as serious and ready to close.

Financially, it positions you to better compare financing options. Without a pre-approval, you may end up accepting dealer financing that isn't the most competitive.

The benefits don’t stop there. If you're working to improve your credit, starting with a pre-approval helps you understand what lenders are seeing. It also gives you an opportunity to correct errors on your credit report ahead of time.

Taking the time to get pre-approved can save you stress, time, and money — and often leads to a better buying experience overall.

How to Get Pre-Approved:

1. Gather your income details and ID.
2. Know your credit score.
3. Use a simple online form like ours.
4. Review your offers.

    title: "Understanding Your Credit Score",
    summary: "How your credit score affects car loan rates and approval.",
    content: `A good credit score can save you thousands on a car loan. In Canada, scores generally range from 300 to 900. Here's how they break down:

- 760+ = Excellent
- 725–759 = Very Good
- 660–724 = Good
- 560–659 = Fair
- Below 560 = Poor

Why it matters: The higher your score, the lower the interest rate you'll likely qualify for. Lenders use your score to evaluate your financial responsibility.

Many Canadians don't realize the difference in cost between a 6% loan and a 12% loan over 5 years can exceed $5,000 on the same vehicle.

How to Improve Your Score:

1. Always pay bills on time.
2. Keep your credit card balance under 30% of the limit.
3. Limit credit inquiries.
4. Maintain long-standing accounts.

    title: "Choosing the Right Loan Term",
    summary: "Should you pick a 3-year or 7-year loan? Here’s what to consider.",
    content: `Choosing the right car loan term is one of the biggest decisions in auto financing. Loan terms typically range from 36 to 84 months.

Shorter terms = higher monthly payments, but lower total interest.
Longer terms = lower payments, but more paid in interest overall.

---

For Example:

A $30,000 loan at 6% interest:
- Over 36 months = ~$913/mo, $2,867 total interest
- Over 72 months = ~$500/mo, $5,976 total interest

---

Which Term Is Best?

- Choose 36-48 months if you can afford higher monthly payments and want to minimize interest.
- Choose 60-72 months if you prefer lower monthly payments but are okay paying more over time.
